Plots go, in order of complexity:

1. Basic circular orbit (only heat in and heat out)
2. Rotating planet (Day/Night cycle - resonance with orbit)
3. Elliptical orbit (Seasons due to difference in speed at different places in orbit)
4. Tilted Planet (Different temperatures at different latitudes)
5. Heat diffusion (Min temp increases, Max decreases - average likely slightly higher)

The above is our model. Now let's mess around and have some fun and see what happens when:

6. Less heat out. Could be caused by greenhouse gases or something.
